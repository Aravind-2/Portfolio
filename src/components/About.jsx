      <p className="text-slate-400 max-w-5xl leading-relaxed">
        Experienced Cloud & DevOps Engineer specializing in designing, deploying,
        and automating scalable, secure infrastructure across AWS and Azure. I help
        organizations solve key operational challenges—from slow deployments and
        manual workflows to unreliable infrastructure and rising cloud costs—by
        building repeatable, IaC-driven automation, resilient CI/CD pipelines, and
        observability solutions.

      <p className="text-slate-400 max-w-5xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I’ve successfully enabled teams to ship faster with confidence, reduced
        deployment failures, and strengthened reliability metrics across
        environments. My work balances technical rigor with business impact—improving
        deployment velocity, reducing costs, and increasing system uptime.

      <p className="text-slate-400 max-w-5xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Notably, I was recognized as a <strong className="text-slate-300">
        Unit Winner & Regional Finalist</strong> in the TCS GenAI Innovation Challenge
        for building AI-driven solutions in cloud cost optimization and churn
        prediction using GenAI, ML, and RAG technologies.
